Server monitoring and micro service orchestration

![alt tag](https://raw.github.com/danielterra/maestro/master/screenshot.png)

With Maestro you keep a clean interface for all you microservices. When you deploy a service a socket connection is estabilished with maestro, then your service register all the routes it responds. When a request comes to Maestro it fowards that request to the responsable micro service.

You can monitor your servers and connections accessing the /inspector route.

This is a experiment, feel free to fork and contribute.
